                <h5><u>The End</u></h5>
                <p>On the 20/2/15, 7 players from Dave 2 World ventured into the ominous 'End'. There, our heros were faced with one of the toughest monsters in Minecraft, the End Dragon. After multiple deaths, many wasted arrows and a lot of potions smashed, our heros slayed the demon and they were granted an exit from the void that is the End as well as many xp orbs and, of course, the coveted Dragon Egg which now stands in a trophy cabinet in the community center.</p>
